/* 
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

Example

const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;

ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.

Exercise Setup:

const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
*/

const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
myArray[0] = 45;

console.log(myArray);
